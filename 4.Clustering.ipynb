Unsupervised machine learning methods can help tackle these problems.

This notebook will provide an introduction to unsupervised machine learning through a clustering example."

    "Clustering is used to group data points together that are similar to each other. Optimally, a given clustering method will produce groupings with high intra-cluster (within) similarity and low inter-cluster (between) similarity. Clustering algorithms typically require a distance or similarity metric to generate clusters. They take a dataset and a distance metric (and sometimes additional parameters), and they generate clusters based on that distance metric. The most common distance metric used is Euclidean distance, but other commonly-used metrics are Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebyshev, Cosine, Hamming, Pearson, and Mahalanobis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most clustering algorithms also require the user to specify the number of clusters (or some other parameter that indirectly determines the number of clusters) in advance as a parameter. This is often difficult to do a priori and typically makes clustering an iterative and interactive task. Another aspect of clustering that makes it interactive is often the difficulty in automatically evaluating the quality of the clusters. While various analytical clustering metrics have been developed, the best clustering is task-dependent and thus must be evaluated by the user. There may be different clusterings that can be generated with the same data. You can imagine clustering similar news stories based on the topic content, on the writing style or sentiment. The right set of clusters depends on the user and the task at hand. Clustering is therefore typically used for exploring the data, generating clusters, exploring the clusters, and then rerunning the clustering method with different parameters or modifying the clusters (by splitting or merging the previous set of clusters). Interpreting a cluster can be nontrivial: you can look at the centroid of a cluster, look at frequency distributions of different features (and compare them to the prior distribution of each feature), or other aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will focus on **K-Means clustering** (*k* defines the number of clusters), which is considered to be the most commonly used clustering method. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. Select *k* (the number of clusters you want to generate).\n",
    "2. Initialize by selecting k points as centroids of the *k* clusters. This is typically done by selecting k points uniformly at random.\n",
    "3. Assign each point a cluster according to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "4. Recalculate cluster centroids based on the assignment in **(3)** as the mean of all data points belonging to that cluster.\n",
    "5. Repeat **(3)** and **(4)** until convergence."

    "The algorithm stops or \"converges\" when the assignments do not change from one iteration to the next. The final set of clusters, however, depends on the starting points. If initialized differently, it is possible that different clusters are obtained. One common practical trick is to run *k*-means several times, each with different (random) starting points. The *k*-means algorithm is fast, simple, and easy to use, and is often a good first clustering algorithm to try and see if it fits your needs. When the mean of the data points cannot be computed, a related method called *K-medoids* can be used."
