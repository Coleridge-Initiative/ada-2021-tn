    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do when you encounter missing values in your data? Unfortunately, there is usually no *right* answer. However, different decisions on how to address missing values can have different implications on the inferences you draw from any analysis. One option is to omit observations that have missing values, but you may also choose to retain all observations and instead impute these missing values using various techniques. Imputation provides your best guess for each missing point's true value. Here, you will learn how to implement common imputation methods for missing data and how those methods affect outcome measures and inferences.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will focus on 2015-16 Tennessee graduates' earnings during their first year after graduation. The notebook provides demonstrations using the first quarter after graduation and you will replicate using the fourth quarter. Recall that in the Data Exploration: Wages notebook, you initially examined the earnings distribution for all members of this cohort who had positive earnings in this time period in Tennessee. To evaluate the earnings outcomes of all 2015-16 Tennessee graduates, you need to decide what to do when you cannot find their earnings in the Tennessee Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records. A person may not appear in Tennessee's UI wage records for several reasons:\n",
    "- The person is unemployed. \n",
    "- The person is out of labor force, e.g., schooling, childcare, etc...\n",
    "- The person was employed outside of Tennessee.\n",
    "- The person's job is not covered in UI wage records, e.g.,self-employed, independent contractors, federal government works, etc. <a href='https://www.nap.edu/read/10206/chapter/11#294'>(Hotz and Scholz, 2002)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will explore the resulting earnings outcomes after applying different earnings imputation methods. The methods covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "- Dropping all \"missing\" values\n",
    "- Filling in zero for people who do not have records in Tennessee UI wage records data \n",
    "- Substituting missing values with the average earnings of people who are in the same degree fields and have the same gender\n",
    "- Regression imputation\n",
    "- Adding in Ohio, Kentucky, and Missouri UI wage records for the cohort in question"
